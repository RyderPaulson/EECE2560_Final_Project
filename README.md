# EECE2560 Final Project



Authors: Ryder Paulson & Kevin Li



### Running the Program 

The requrements for this project are CMAKE, CLion, and MATLAB. In order to run the project, open the root directory using CLion. Run the EECE2560_Final_Project run configuration. Optionally, open MATLAB before running the program to reduce the delay in the program opening the software. Sample input data has been included in the data folder. When prompted in the program to select an input file, use the relative path. For example: data/AAPL.csv.
